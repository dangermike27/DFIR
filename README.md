This Repo contains public scripts that we handy in DFIR Cases. 
They are by no means perfect, since I am not a software developer - but they worked for me at least once.
I tried to make them as readable as I could.

While developing there were some principles:
- cleartext language - so no compiled stuff. Sometimes you only can copy/paste stuff via text
- function > form
- a dummy needs do work with this

If you have any suggestions or tips - contact me.
