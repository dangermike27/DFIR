# SYNOPSIS
Starts UI for IOC Extraction from a given String or File
# DESCRIPTION
This Script opens a windows forms UI from the System.Windows.Forms .NET Assembly to let you extract IOCs from a given String or File via UI.
The reason behind this, is you cannot always use software or copy anything else than text to a given machine you want to use.
**There are better extractor tools out there - use them if you want good extractions :)**
# EXAMPLE
```.\IOCExtractor.ps1 -verbose```
Starts UI and gives you some more infos on the shell
# NOTES
